\section{Exercise 4}
The geometric object in which the end-effector lives is called the \emph{Workspace}.
\subsection{Forward Kinematics}
The formulation of the forward kinematics is based on \cite{Craig}, which makes use of the \emph{Denavit-Hartenberg} parameters.

For the given formulation, it is assumed that $q_1 \in \left[0,\pi\right]$ and $q_2 \in \left[\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]$.

For brevity, only the Z and X axes of the joint frames are drawn in 2D, axis coming out of the plane is denoted by $\oplus$ and axis going into the plane is denoted by $\otimes$.
