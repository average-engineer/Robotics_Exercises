\subsection{Parallel Robot}
The topology tree will contain fourteen (including the top-platform and base) nodes depicting the links and eighteen edges depiciting the joints (six of which are the prismatic joints). The prismatic joint edges are colored green and the spherical joints are colored blue. The base link is depicted by B and the top platform is depicted by EE.
